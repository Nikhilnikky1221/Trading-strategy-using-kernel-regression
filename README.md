# Trading-strategy-using-kernel-regression
* Kernel regression can be seen as a smoother version of nearest neighbor methods, where instead of relying on just a few most immediate neighbors, it considers all data points but weighs them differently based on their proximity. The kernel function assigns higher weights to nearby data points and lower weights to those farther away. This allows the model to give more importance to nearby observations in estimating the value of the target variable for a particular input.
* using kernel regression, we can get a smoothed price line, which I used to make an envelope. The upper bound of the envelope is two standard deviations above the smoothed price line, and similarly, the lower bound is two standard deviations below the smoothed price line.
* if the price crosses the upper bound, then the stock is overbought, so the algorithm generates a sell signal, and if the price crosses the lower bound, then the store is oversold, so the algorithm generates a buy signal.
* to know volatility in the stock, I used the Average true range(ATR), and the stop loss and target are calculated based on ATR and a fixed risk-to-reward ratio.
